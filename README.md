## Features

### Overview

- **Real-time Monitoring** - Track file changes as they happen
- **Daemon Architecture** - Keeps tracking even when you're not watching
- **SQLite Storage** - Query your file change history
- **Interactive TUI** - Keyboard-driven interface
- **Smart Filtering** - Focus on what matters
- **Event Statistics** - File sizes, line counts, and more

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `q` - Exit
- `space` - Pause/Resume event stream (auto refreshing tracking)
- `a`/`u` - Show all events / Show latest event per file
- `Enter` - Apply event-type / keyword filters
- `ESC` - Cancel current filter / Clear all filters

### Event Filtering

Filter events by type (`f`, `c`, `m`, `d`, `v`, `r`) or search by keyword (`/`).
See [detailed filtering guide](docs/event-filtering.md) for more information.

## Current Scope

- **Git Operations**: Currently doesn't track some operations, such as git stash or merge, and so on - only file system changes
- **Keyword Filtering**: Simple text matching only - regular expressions not yet supported
- **Supplementary Tool**: Designed as a monitoring assistant, not a replacement for git history or version control
